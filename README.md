*Before you kick in, just a heads up the assignment is based on Java Selenium not Playwright. I am not familiar enough with playwright to jump in for the assignment.
*The suite uses Java 8, Selenium 4.24, TestNG 7.10.2 and webdrivermanager 5.9.2
*You can pull the repo to your system and it will be good to go, no need to set paths for webdriver driver since webdrivermanager will do the work
*You can find the last run test report under \RTCampQAEngineerAssignment_Jaya_Prakash\rtCampQA\target (Usually found under test-output folder, I've changed this file for visibility)
*Lastly I apologize for not recording vods on test, (cries with a slow laptop)
*Hopefully I will meet you soon, GLHF! (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜)
